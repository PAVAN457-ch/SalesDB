1. What is tuple in Python? What is the difference between list and tuple?
A) tuple is immutable object and list is mutable objects.List is defined with bracckets [] and tuple is defined with parathesis ()

2. What are the rules for a local and global variable in Python?
A) local variable decliars within the function and goble variable is listed outside the function

3. What is Python's parameter passing mechanism? Name it and explain it.
A) Python's parameter passing with pass by object and pass by reference this combines both passing perameters. 
For immutable objects will be pass by value for mutable objects wil be pass by reference.

4. Write a method to open a text file and display its content?
A) to open file and display its content in python we can use funtcions open() and read()
def display_file_content(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        print(file.read())

# Example usage:
file_path = 'example.txt'
display_file_content(file_path)

5. You have two lists: strList = ["Vishesh", "For", "Python"] and valList = [1, 2] for the first two tasks
and one list valList = [1, 2, 3] for third task. Write the sintax so you will get these results:

1) {'key2': ['Vishesh', 'For', 'Python'], 'key1': [1, 2]}
2) {'key1': [1, 2, ['vishesh', 'For', 'python']]}
3) {'1': [1, 2], '3': [3, 4], '2': [2, 3]} # Creating a dictionary of lists using list comprehension.

A)
1)strList = ["Vishesh", "For", "Python"]
valList = [1, 2]

result = {'key1': valList, 'key2': strList}
print(result)

 2)strList = ["Vishesh", "For", "Python"]
valList = [1, 2]

result = {'key1': [1, 2, strList]}
print(result)

3)valList = [1, 2, 3]
result = {str(i): [i, i+1] for i in valList}
print(result)
